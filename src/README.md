# Timed Written Response Practice

Minimal Next.js (App Router) practice app that simulates a 10-minute timed written response with an optional live webcam preview.

- Webcam is live-only and stays on-device (no recording, no uploads, no storage).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.
